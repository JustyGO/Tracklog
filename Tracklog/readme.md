# üé® Masterpiece NFT Gallery

This project is a **Clarity smart contract** that implements a decentralized **art gallery** for managing, exhibiting, and trading unique digital masterpieces as **non-fungible tokens (NFTs)** on the Stacks blockchain.

It supports:

* Creating NFTs with built-in artist commission logic
* Exhibiting artworks in the gallery at a chosen price
* Updating or removing exhibitions with safeguards
* Acquiring artworks with automatic commission distribution
* Gifting artworks between collectors
* Administrative gallery management (curator role, maintenance mode)



## üìú Features

### üîπ NFT Creation

* Each artwork (`masterpiece-id`) is minted as a **unique NFT**.
* The original artist defines a **commission rate** (up to 25%) that applies to all future sales.

### üîπ Exhibitions

* Owners can **exhibit** their masterpiece at a chosen price (within allowed limits).
* Exhibitions can be **updated** but only once every **24 hours**.
* Artworks can be **removed** from exhibitions at any time.

### üîπ Acquisition

* Collectors can acquire exhibited masterpieces by paying the exhibition price.
* The contract automatically splits payment:

  * A commission goes to the **original artist**.
  * The remainder goes to the **current owner**.
* NFT ownership is transferred securely to the collector.

### üîπ Gifting

* Owners may **gift artworks** directly to another wallet.

### üîπ Governance & Maintenance

* The **gallery owner** can appoint a **curator**.
* The curator can toggle **maintenance mode** (pausing all core functions).
